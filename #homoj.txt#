What was your childhood like?

People often considered me the brightest of my siblings, and I was tutured and trained by many people in many things. I also participated in many fun activities, such as jousting, hawking, hunting, and horse breeding for the Palio. I even won a prize for the best men at arms when I was 19!

How is your relationship with the Pazzi family? I heard you were both very powerful, so it seems like you could be friends!

It wasn't good in the slightest, as they resented my power. On Sunday, April 26th, 1478, during High Mass at the Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore, they tried to kill me, and succeeded in killing my brother Giuliano. When I finally was safe and back in power, most of those who took part in this conspiricy were caught and summarily executed. As for the Pazzis who weren't in this conspiracy, they were banished from Florence, lands and property confiscated, coat of arms perpetually suppressed, name erased from public registers, all buildings and streets carrying it renamed, and shield with dolphins obliterated everywhere. Those named Pazzi would have to take a new name, and anyone married to a Pazzi was barred from public office.

What was your education like?

Very very interesting! I had a rather unusual education which followed a pedagogical plan which my father developed, with the help of some of his humanist friends. Soon after birth, I was brought to a small cottage, where I lived the first three years of my life in the sole company of a peasent family, in order to be close to the people who would need my help and the life conditions of them. After this, I was brought back home, with the objective to have my speak Latin as my first language. In this case, my father made sure that everyone who spoke to me knew and used only latin.

I was accompanied with constant intellectual and spiritual stimulation, such as music when I woke up and familierization with Greek via a pedagogical method which employed games, conversation, and excercises of solitary meditation. Generally, my childhood was quite nice, filled with liberty and delight! I was quite free in studying many things!

Around the year 1539. I started a more typical education, which eventually led to a law degree

Did you get any insights about education from your rather unusual pedagogical method.

I personally think that education should be a rather fun and self-encouraging thing, rather than a boring forced subject. For example, I think that a child should apply their education to their own life, in practice rather than theory, and, rather than memorize raw facts, should actually understand whatever subject they are talking about. I also believe that by utilizing fear and punishment in education, a teacher simply fills a students head with information, rather than inspiring a love of knowledge. I also think a student should have a rather moderate workload, rather than one such as mine with 15 hours of vigorous study. I also think that a student and scholer should speak in plain terms, so that the language draws attention to the subject rather than itself

Galileo Galilei

Do you have any physical evidence for the Earth revolving around the Sun?

Well, there are many ways water in a container -- in this example, a vase -- can move. One way the movement of the contained water can be changed is via the slope of the vase. Another way is an external cause, such as a large wind. A third cause of water moving, however, is the movement of this hypothetical vase itself.

This can also be extended to the Earth moving. The Copernican earth is affected by two main circular motions, ie. the annual revolution around the sun and the diurnal rotation. Due to an additive effect of these motions, there is an alteration yes
in the surface speed of the earth every 12 hours, which causes the water of the earth to change from moving east to moving west and back again. Since tides are explained so well by the Copernican theory, it would only make sense that it is correct.

Do you have any other arguments against geocentric and Aristolian models of the universe?

Yes, I have several. For example, using a high-power telescope which I designed and built, I discovered three stars which orbit around Jupiter, which is incompatible with the Aristolian model because Jupiter is not the Earth, and the Aristolian model requires that all objects orbit around the earth. I also found that Venus exhibited a full set of phases, which is incompatible with the geocentric model since it requires Venus to either be on the near or far side of the sun, but not switching between them, which would mean that it would only be able to have some of the phases which I observed but not all.

Filippo Brunelleschi

How did you build the dome of the Florence Cathedral without it collapsing during construction???

A veriety of methods. The dome contains an inner shell made of a lightweight material which workers can sit on and a wind-resistant outer shell, with a ring and rib support system going between them. The bricks are also layed in a herringbone pattern, which redirects the weight outward towards the dome supports instead of the floor, thereby making it so the bricks don't end up falling to the ground during construction.

What kind of machinary did you use to build the dome?

Several peices of very complicated machinary. For example, I made a three-speed hoist, powered by single oxen turning a wooden tiller, which could even be reversed without turning the oxen around, for amazing lifting capability, and many other lifting machines too, such as the castello, which could move lifted loads laterally. 

William Gilbert

Where did you get the word "electrus" (which the English word "Electricity" was derived from)?

I noticed that certein objects tended to attract other objects when rubbed in the same way that amber attracts them when it is rubbed. For this reason, I decided to name this force "electrus," which means "like amber" in Latin, in order to convay that this force related to things which were like amber in their electrical properties.

Why do you think that electricity and magnatism are not the same thing?

I believe that electricity and magnatism are not the same thing because electrical attracion dissapears with heat, while magnetic attraction does not. Since these two forces to not behave the same in these circumstances, I do not believe that they can be the same.

What is your theory on why compasses point North?

Why do you think compasses very based on location?

Francis Bacon

How does your philosophy of science differ from the Aristotilian view?

I personally think that science should be based on inductive reasoning, using imperical evidence which makes it so a premise is more likely to be true than other premises, rather than the deductive reasoning of Aristotle, where one bases an argument on a set of assumed true rules in order to make a 100% true argument. I believe that this should be the case because... (find answer here) 

I heard you wrote a book called New Atlantis. What was it about?

It's a novel which helps to describe a utopian research facility called Salomon's House. In this facility, trained teams of investigators collect data, conduct experiments, and actually apply all of this knowledge to create useful things to share with the outside world. Although it has a plot, it's mostly for filler, with the books main purpose being to describe this wonderful place. I was also planning on making more books about this world in an entire series, but then I died therefore couldn't complete them.
