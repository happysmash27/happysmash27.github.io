	<h1>Career</h1>
	<p>After much debating, I have decided that the best career path to achieve my goals is probably to create my own C Corporation which automatically manufacturs and distrubutes physical items, using money made from cryptocurrency investing. This does not have a static salary, and it is quite hard for me to estimate at the moment when I have no data on demand. Theoretically, it could make a huge amount of money, although I plan to keep my actual salary as low as possible in order to invest more into the company with no tax. That's the interesting thing about corporations, especially those of the C veriety: they are only taxed on money they do not reinvest back into the company at the end of the year. </p>
	<h2>401k/403B options</h2>
	  <p>401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, and similar are ways in which one can save for retirement in the United States tax-free<sup><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/401(k)">[1]</a></cite></sup>. They are not neccessary, as there are other ways to save, but could certainly be very useful. I do not plan on doing this personally, since I do not plan on being in the United States for much longer. </p>
