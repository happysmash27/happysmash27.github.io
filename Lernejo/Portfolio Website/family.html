      <p>Look, I'm not having a family until I am self-sufficient and have my expenses at $0. I am not having a boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife either if they demand I pay money for them, as that goes greatly against my ideals. For this reason, the cost of a significant other for me would be $0, and the cost of having a family would be whatever the cost of Anarkikomunismolando is, since I plan on using that in order to become self-sufficient. Alternatively, I could probably create a homestead for less than $30,000. </p>

	<p>I may have pets before I am self-sufficient, however, so they could cost a bit of money. In order to reduce the consumption of meet which dogs or cats may carry out, I would probably adopt a pig. I would also likely do this because pigs are very intelligent, and I simply like pigs. According to <a href="http://www.9sites.org/pigrescue/adoptionchecklist.htm">http://www.9sites.org/pigrescue/adoptionchecklist.htm</a>, the average annual cost for raising a pig is over $900. A homestead in order to give the pig room as well as all of the initial items to care for the pig would probably cost less than $30,000. </p>
