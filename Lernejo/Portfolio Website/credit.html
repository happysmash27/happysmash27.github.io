	<h1>Credit</h1>
	<p>A credit score is a numerical expression based on the credit history of a legal entity which is used to represent the likelyhood that this legal entity will be able to pay off borrowed debt.</p>
	<p>Credit is the method which allows banks to create money out of nothing, and allows banks to enslave many ill-informed consumer sheep with debt. Money in the bank is really only a digital "IOU" from the bank to the account holder. Since most people do not take all the money owed from the bank out at the same time, banks are able to loan out 10 times the actual money they have to borrowers. Worse, however, this IOU money can be deposited at a bank, and seen by the bank as real money. This means that the bank can loan out 10 times this money as well, even though in reality this new money is only an IOU. For this reason, most money in the economy is actually credit, and if everyone decided to withdraw everything from every bank at the same time, the bank wouldn't be able to give people their money since it doesn't actually exist! A good explenation can be found <a href="http://positivemoney.org/how-money-works/how-banks-create-money/">here</a> as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation">on Wikipedia</a>. Through interest, banks can also keep people who are not very informed about finance perpetually enslaved in debt, and it is quite hard to pay off this debt to get out of debt slavery. </p>
	<p>Credit score ranges can vary based on which credit score is being looked at. Some jurisdictions don't have a numerical credit score at all, but a blacklist system or something else; many other systems have scores which range from 300 to 900. In the US, many different type of credit score systems exist, which have ranges such as 0-300 for FICO SBSS; 300-850 for VantageScore 3.0, generic FICO scores, FICO mortgage scores, and CoreLogic Credco scores; 150-950 for FICO NextGen; 250-900 for FICO bankcard scores and FICO auto scores; 100-899 for ChexSystems scores; and 100-850 for PRBC scores. Like ranges, the factors affecting credit scores also range between which scoring system is used, and the exact algorithm is often propreitary. </p>
