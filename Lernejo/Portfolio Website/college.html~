	<h1>Colleges</h1>
	<p>There are several colleges I am interested in.</p>
	<p>The first college I am interested in attending is the <a href="https://www.tu-dortmund.de/uni/de/Uni/">Technical University of Dortmund</a>, as it offers courses I am interested in, is tuition free even for foreigners due to being in Germany, and because it has a nice monorail system.</p>
	<p>The second college I am looking at is the <a href="https://www.tum.de/">Technical University of Munich</a>, since it also offers courses I am interested in, and is free due to being in Germany.</p>
	<p>For the same reason, I am also interested in the similerly named <a href="https://www.tu-berlin.de/">Technical University of Berlin</a>; it offers all of the courses I am interested as well, and has the tuition-free aspect too, since it is also in Germany.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
	<p>Price for 4 years of 8 semesters: <b>Free</b>. If it wasn't free, I wouldn't be able to afford it and therefore would not be able to go. </p>

	<h1>Alternative Options</h1>
	<p>One thing I may do instead of going to college to get a degree is to simply do my own research and start a company in order to fund my big project <a href="https://anarkikomunismolando.org">Anarkikomunismolando</a>. Many good resources exist for learning online, including <a href="https://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>; <a href="https://wikiversity.org">Wikiversity</a>, another Wikimedia project; and various other resources, such as <a href="http://publications.gbdirect.co.uk/c_book/">The C Book</a>. I may also be able to learn a lot simply by creating the things I want to create, and using what I learn creating them to create more complicated things. A big advantage of this plan is that I can do this right now, and indeed, am already doing it. In the current phase of the plan, I am investing in <a href="https://theqrl.org/">QRL</a> and researching how to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_corporation">C Corporation</a> in order to properly sell things. With this C Corporation, I shall be able to buy more and more machines to automatically create things, and through much research on engineering, should eventually be able to engineer these machines myself so people will be able to create them without buying them from corporations, as well as many structures in order to establish the initial settlement of Anarkikomunismolando. These machines will make more and more money for the initial establishment of Anarkikomunismolando. Eventually, as more and more machines are bought lower and lower on the supply chain, the entire thing will be automated, from mining to distribution of products. At this point, money would no longer be needed to purchase resources for the machines to make things. This would allow the establishment of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy">Gift economy</a> where everything is given away for free and money is completely unnecessary. </p>
