	<h1>My Future</h1>
	<p>My ideas for the future are quite world-changing, but in case those don't work, I have many, many fallbacks. One such idea involves creating a micronation in Antarctica, as can be seen <a href="https://reddit.com/r/micronations/comments/6cl7pe/i_want_to_create_a_new_democratictechnocratic/">here</a> (<a href="https://grex.org/~happysmash27/anarkikomunismolando2.html">mirror</a>), with some examples of fallback being to create it in another place (e.g. the ocean), to go to another similer micronation, e.g. <a href="https://liberland.org/en/main/">Liberland</a>, or perhaps just to go to an existing country which doesn't have property tax so I don't have to worry about rent, a list of which which can be found at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax#Places_without_property_tax">Wikipedia</a>. This requires a lot of funding, so I will likely have to do quite a lot of business, and I also want to create open source computer components as well, which requires quite a lot of knowledge of electrical engineering as well as lots and lots of money. However, if I don't have enough funding, for example, I have a fallback for this idea too: I have many other areas I want to work in, including YouTubing, game development, software development, IT work, engineering, as well as many other jobs.</p>
