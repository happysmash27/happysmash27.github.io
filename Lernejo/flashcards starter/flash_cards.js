	      {demando: "<b>Function</b>", respondo: "In computer programming, a <b>subroutine</b> is a sequence of program instructions that perform a specific task, packaged as a unit. This unit can then be used in programs wherever that particular task should be performed.<br/><br/>Subprograms may be defined within programs, or separately in libraries that can be used by multiple programs. In different programming languages, a subroutine may be called a <b>procedure</b>, a <b>function</b>, a <b>routine</b>, a <b>method</b>, or a <b>subprogram</b>. The generic term <b>callable unit</b> is sometimes used."},

	      {demando: "<b>Conditional Statement</b>", respondo: "In computer science, <b>conditional statements</b>, <b>conditional expressions</b> and <b>conditional constructs</b> are features of a programming language, which perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false."},
	      {demando: "<b>Parameters</b>", respondo: "In computer programming, a <b>parameter</b> is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine. These pieces of data are called <b>arguments</b>. An ordered list of parameters is usually included in the definition of a subroutine, so that, each time the subroutine is called, its arguments for that call can be assigned to the corresponding parameters."},
	      {demando: "<b>Return Value</b>", respondo: "A <b>return value</b> is a variable passed back to the code after a function ends. In JavaScript, one can get this by assigning the function run code to a variable."},
	      {demando: "<b>Variable</b>", respondo: "In computer programming, a <b>variable</b> or <b>scalar</b> is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value."},
	      {demando: "<b>Assignment Operator</b>", respondo: "In computer programming, an <b>assignment statement</b> sets and/or re-sets the value stored in the storage location(s) denoted by a variable name; in other words, it copies a value into the variable. In most imperative programming languages, the assignment statement (or expression) is a fundamental construct.<br/><br/>Today, the most commonly used notation for this basic operation has come to be <code><i>x</i> = <i>expr</i></code> (originally Superplan 1949–51, popularized by Fortran 1957 and C) followed by <code><i>x</i> := <i>expr</i></code> (originally ALGOL 1958, popularised by Pascal), although there are many other notations in use. In some languages the symbol used is regarded as an <b>operator</b> (meaning that the assignment has a value) while others define the assignment as a <b>statement</b> (meaning that it cannot be used in an expression)."},
	      {demando: "<b>Array</b>", respondo: "In computer science, an <b>array data structure</b>, or simply an <b>array</b>, is a data structure consisting of a collection of <i>elements</i> (values or variables), each identified by at least one <i>array index</i> or <i>key</i>. An array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula."},
	      {demando: "<b>Syntax</b>", respondo: "In computer science, the <b>syntax</b> of a computer language is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment in that language. "},
	      {demando: "<b>Concatenation</b>", respondo: "In formal language theory and computer programming, <b>string concatenation</b> is the operation of joining character strings end-to-end."},
	      {demando: "<b>String</b>", respondo: "In computer programming, a <b>string</b> is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable."},
	      {demando: "<b>Object</b>", respondo: "In computer science, an <b>object</b> can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, is a location in memory having a value and referenced by an identifier.<br/><br/>In the class-based object-oriented programming paradigm, \"object\" refers to a particular instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.<br/><br/>In relational database management, an object can be a table or column, or an association between data and a database entity (such as relating a person's age to a specific person).omputer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server."},
	      {demando: "<b>Property</b>", respondo: "A <b>property</b>, in some object-oriented programming languages, is a special sort of class member, intermediate in functionality between a field (or data member) and a method. The syntax for reading and writing of properties is like for fields, but property reads and writes are (usually) translated to 'getter' and 'setter' method calls. The field-like syntax is easier to read and write than lots of method calls, yet the interposition of method calls \"under the hood\" allows for data validation, active updating (e.g., of GUI elements), or implementation of what may be called \"read-only fields\"."}, 
	      {demando: "<b>Method</b>", respondo: "A <b>method</b> in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object is mostly made up of data and behavior, which form the interface that an object presents to the outside world. Data is represented as properties of the object and behavior as methods. For example, a Window object would have methods such as open and close, while its state (whether it is opened or closed) would be a property."}];
