      <p>In my opinion, investing in cryptocurrency is a very good idea. Not only does it have massive returns, but it gets us away from the greedy banks.</p>
      <p>Generally, central banks meddle in the affairs of the economy, often in ways harmful to your savings. Did you know that when the U.S. Government takes out loans, it's from the Federal Reserve? But far more sinister, the Federal Reserve is actually a private company, and prints money to drive the economy and for giving these government loans (printing money being legal in this case, with them being the only one allowed to do so). Money printing causes inflation, and although inflation drives the economy forward, it makes savings worth less and less over time. With large cryptocurrencies, however, the value is worth more over time instead of less, as there is a fixed supply.</p>
      <h2>In Summery for cryptocurrencies in general:</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Decentralization</li>
	<li>No federal reserve inflation messing with your savings</li>
	<li>Huge investment returns if you chose the good ones</li>
	<li>All benefits which may be able to be gotten from a specific currency you chose</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Vertcoin</h2>
      <p>My personal favorite cryptocurrency is Vertcoin. This is for several reasons:</p>
      <ol>
	<li>ASIC resistance, keeping the hands in the community</li>
	<li>A dev team which truly believes in the cause</li>
	<li>Anonymous address support</li>
	<li>Very undervalued right now, meaning that I can afford a LOT</li>
      </ol>
