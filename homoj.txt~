What was your childhood like?

People often considered me the brightest of my siblings, and I was tutured and trained by many people in many things. I also participated in many fun activities, such as jousting, hawking, hunting, and horse breeding for the Palio. I even won a prize for the best men at arms when I was 19!

How is your relationship with the Pazzi family? I heard you were both very powerful, so it seems like you could be friends!

It wasn't good in the slightest, as they resented my power. On Sunday, April 26th, 1478, during High Mass at the Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore, they tried to kill me, and succeeded in killing my brother Giuliano. When I finally was safe and back in power, most of those who took part in this conspiricy were caught and summarily executed. As for the Pazzis who weren't in this conspiracy, they were banished from Florence, lands and property confiscated, coat of arms perpetually suppressed, name erased from public registers, all buildings and streets carrying it renamed, and shield with dolphins obliterated everywhere. Those named Pazzi would have to take a new name, and anyone married to a Pazzi was barred from public office.

What was your education like?

Very very interesting! I had a rather unusual education which followed a pedagogical plan which my father developed, with the help of some of his humanist friends. Soon after birth, I was brought to a small cottage, where I lived the first three years of my life in the sole company of a peasent family, in order to be close to the people who would need my help and the life conditions of them. After this, I was brought back home, with the objective to have my speak Latin as my first language. In this case, my father made sure that everyone who spoke to me knew and used only latin.

I was accompanied with constant intellectual and spiritual stimulation, such as music when I woke up and familierization with Greek via a pedagogical method which employed games, conversation, and excercises of solitary meditation. Generally, my childhood was quite nice, filled with liberty and delight! I was quite free in studying many things!

Around the year 1539. I started a more typical education, which eventually led to a law degree

Did you get any insights about education from your rather unusual pedagogical method.

I personally think that education should be a rather fun and self-encouraging thing, rather than a boring forced subject. For example, I think that a child should apply their education to their own life, in practice rather than theory, and, rather than memorize raw facts, should actually understand whatever subject they are talking about. I also believe that by utilizing fear and punishment in education, a teacher simply fills a students head with information, rather than inspiring a love of knowledge. I also think a student should have a rather moderate workload, rather than one such as mine with 15 hours of vigorous study. I also think that a student and scholer should speak in plain terms, so that the language draws attention to the subject rather than itself
